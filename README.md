# CodingFails
A repo for the worst of my coding blunders, especially older code from April, 2023. Old shame is a thing in coding too.

I was (and still is) a sloppy coder, dragged into the mesmerizing world of zeros and ones by chance of image editing. Bearing my half-baked knowledge of elementary algebra and basic geometry, I set my hands on matrices and transforms and made a mess.

I will look at my own code and evaluate the errors and inadequacies, seeing how I can improve. Also, I'd be glad if this will help anyone to avoid the mistakes I have made.

I might try to do remakes for some of these projects, after learning the normal/correct/optimal way to achieve the desired functionality.

1. __astronaut-adrift.py__

   In April, 2023, after learning FuncAnimation in matplotlib, I tried to recreate the classic Windows XP screensaver "the astronaut adrift" with this program. It was not very successful.

2. __noise-reduce.py__

   After reading about noise reduction on Wikipedia, I tried to tackle the problem by myself. Not only did I fail to make the wheel, but I also broke the cart in the process.

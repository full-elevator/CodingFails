# CodingFails
I'm inventing square wheels again. This is where I start my new projects.

I was (and still is) a sloppy coder, dragged into the mesmerizing world of zeros and ones by chance of image editing. Bearing my half-baked knowledge of elementary algebra and basic geometry, I set my hands on matrices and transforms and made a mess.

To *reinvent the wheel* means to "do something in a wholly and drastically new way, often unnecessarily" (The Free Dictionary). But I occasionally try to code a functionality from the ground up, and end up with an inelegant, inefficient solution. I liken such mishaps to *inventing a square wheel*.

In the following examples, I will document my slips and inadequacies, seeing how I can improve. Also, I'd be glad if this will help anyone to avoid the mistakes I have made.

I might try to do remakes for some of these projects, after learning the normal/correct/optimal way to achieve the desired functionality.

1. **astronaut-adrift.py**

   In April 2023, after learning FuncAnimation in matplotlib, I tried to recreate the classic Windows XP screensaver "the astronaut adrift" with this program. It was not very successful.

2. **noise-reduce.py**

   After reading about noise reduction on Wikipedia, I tried to tackle the problem by myself. Not only did I fail to make the wheel, but I also broke the cart in the process.
